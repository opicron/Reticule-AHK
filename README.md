# Reticule-AHK
##Crosshair AHK script

Reticule uses an transparant overlay window to draw an crosshair over games running in fullscreen windowed mode(!). Think of the Muble overlay with more functionality and less bulk.

It is not possible for this script, now nor in the future, to draw over games running fullscreen mode.

*Disclaimer: Custom crosshair overlays are allowed by most game developers. No resposibility is taken if your account is banned for using this script. I have been using this script for years and no issues have arrised so far.*
