# Reticule-AHK
====================
Crosshair AHK script
====================

Reticule is an script which draws an crosshair over an fullscreen windowed mode(!) display. 
Reticule will _not_, nor in the future, work with fullscreen mode games.

Features:
- multiple crosshairs included
- opacity of crosshairs can be set
- position of crosshairs can be adjusted per pixel
- crosshairs can be switched on the fly
- individual settings per crosshair!
- only draws crosshair when game is in focus

Keys:
- [windowskey] + page-up      set opacity (loops from 1 to 0.5)
- [windowskey] + end          loop through crosshairs in /gfx (PNG only)
- [windowskey] + home         save configuration
- [windowskey] + [arrowkeys]  move crosshair


Notes:
- reload the script after adding or renaming crosshairs!
- add your game window class to the script else it will not show!
